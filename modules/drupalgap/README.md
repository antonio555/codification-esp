## Setup

### Setting up the DrupalGap 8 Module

1. Download and enable the DrupalGap 8 Module as usual: `drush en drupalgap`
2. Complete the jDrupal set up instructions located here:

- http://cgit.drupalcode.org/jdrupal/plain/README.md

DrupalGap hooks into jDrupal, so jDrupal must be properly configured first, and then DrupalGap will be ready for use.

## Getting started with DrupalGap
